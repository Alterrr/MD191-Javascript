*I suggest writing the code as you watch the video -- stop and run to make sure you got everything, then move on. Once you have a simple quiz that runs properly, think about how to add more features to it.*

- Those popups are not the nicest way of building a quiz, look at how to read content from forms:

# Quiz
Index.html and script.js contain the basic code developed in the tutorial psoted above plus an extra feature to count right answers. Index1.html and script1.js are slightly nicer versions with a button to start the quiz.
